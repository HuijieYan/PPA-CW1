#0 -> FP, all allocations inside eval_string_expression have null check
#1 -> TP, fstat just fetches info for the file, if if fails the file is not closed
#2 -> FP it seems
#3 -> FP it does get initialised by same if statement before
#4 -> TP, local var?
#5 -> TP, local var?
#6 -> FP, all allocations inside eval_string_expression have null check
#7 -> FP? Depends if conf properly defined and guaranteed to have &(conf->database_…) not null
#8 -> FP, used for checks of return values
#9 -> TP, no check if st is null on localtime call and no check of errno in between
#10 -> TP? parentname not null because checked_strdup guarantees it, but assumes it contains ‘\’ in there
#11 -> TP, no check after, local var
Rest -> ? In yacc file

FP seems like a valid function function call

Spray
#0 -> TP
#1-3 -> dependencies
#1 -> FP, is initialised just in weird way
#2 -> TP
#3 -> TP
#4 -> TP
#5 -> TP !!

XERXES
#0 -> FP
#1 -> TP
#2 -> FP
#3 -> FP
#4 -> FP

Hash
#0 -> FP, hard to see because of the MACROS, but following the substitutions leads to reads only happening when flag is true, and there’s an assignment when that same flag is true
#1-9 -> TP seems true, following macros, hash_new uses calloc without checking for null after
